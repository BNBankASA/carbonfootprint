# BN Bank: Carbon footprint method
Footprint calculations are a method for calculating the direct and indirect impact of BN Bank's activity on our common environment and climate.
We have a spotlight on our impact on the climate and in this analysis look at our carbon footprint, ie how much emissions of greenhouse gases
our activity leads to. Carbon footprint is a narrowing of environmental footprint, which does not look exclusively at the direct impact on 
climate, but also on other environmental impacts. In line with the development of standards and methods, we will also report a larger one part 
of our environmental footprint in the coming years. 

We calculate our carbon footprint according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and we divide the emissions into three scopes. The different
scopes identify how close the emissions are to core operations and whether the emissions can be affected directly or indirectly by us. The figure below
is based on the GHG protocol and shows a schematic overview of which activities fall into the three degrees of scope. Scope 1,
describes direct emissions from production. This includes typically the use of fuel in the company's cars or consumption of raw materials in 
production. The bank has one company vehicle, except that the bank does not consume raw materials or other inputs that create direct
emissions. Scope 2 is emissions related to the consumption of electricity and district heating. Consumption from owned buildings and facilities
shall be included, and consumption from rented facilities if one has operational control over the buildings. 

Scope 3 captures all other emissions. This is emissions that are created by other businesses and the consumption of our products. It is custom to split 
Scope 3 emission into two parts. The first, where we through our consumption of services and goods from our partners and providers contribute to 
increased greenhouse gas emissions. This is called upstream, i.e. emissions which occurs before the goods or services are delivered. While downstream 
is the consumption and distribution of the goods or services the company delivers. In a bank is this is the emissions that are created when a payment 
is made possible by the bank's payment service or when homes are built and operated with loan from the bank. 

Our scope 2 and scope 3 emissions are thus also booked by other companies. It is nevertheless of interest to measure
emissions of our downstream emissions and the development in these, as it is a good measure of how we affect our partners, suppliers and customers.

Openness is important to us. We want feedback to make our calculations better and for others to learn from what we do. Therefore is
our calculations available to those who want insight into our methods.
